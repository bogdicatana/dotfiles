# My Linux setup

## Description
I got into customizing the look of my arch linux system in order to develop better UI/UX skills.

## Featuring:
- [hyprland](https://github.com/hyprwm/Hyprland) a dynamic tiling Wayland compositor
- [ags](https://github.com/Aylur/ags) for the system widget (logout, restart etc.) as well as the app search widget
- [waybar](https://github.com/Alexays/Waybar) (design inspired by [cjbassi](https://github.com/cjbassi/config/tree/master/.config/waybar)'s configuration)
- [zed](https://github.com/zed-industries/zed) code editor
- [dunst](https://github.com/dunst-project/dunst) for the notification daemon
- [oh my zsh](https://ohmyz.sh/) framework for my zsh shell
- [pywal](https://github.com/dylanaraps/pywal) for terminal colors that match my wallpaper
